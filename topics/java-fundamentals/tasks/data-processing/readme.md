## Topics

* Strings
* Math classes
* Generics

## Requirements

1. Implement simple console menu for application. For example first user choose the type of number that will be
    processed (types are listed below). Then he chooses how to process it (variants are listed below).
2. Data types that must be processed:

4. Numbers must be generated in a random way and stored in ArrayList.
5. Use generics to implement task.
