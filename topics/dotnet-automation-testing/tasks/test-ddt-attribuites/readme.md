* Nunit framework. Parameterized tests
* Xunit framework. Parameterized tests

## Requirements

* Create parameterized tests using test framework attributes and pass data into your test methods in different ways:
  * set the values of the parameter of the test. Different input data and expected results should be specified to
        perform the test of few examples of the multiplication table for six .
  * get the values from a method or a property and specify the input data for the test. Loading data from a property on
        the test class/on a different class to perform the comparison of the pairs of numbers(6 pairs of numbers) and assess
        the result.
  * use the xml file as a source of input data and expected result. Create xml file for test of the multiplication table
        for two. Use the data from xml file as a source of input data and the expected result for the test.
