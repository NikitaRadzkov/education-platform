* Scrum

## Requirements

You are a Project Manager (congrats!) and your team consists of the following people:

1. Mike - Senior Fullstack Developer, team lead, the most experienced person on the project.
2. Kate - Middle Frontend Developer, very talented, potentially the next team lead.
3. Alex - Middle Backend Developer.
4. Dmitry - senior QA engineer.
5. Ann - Junior Frontend Developer.

* Use any suitable task tracking app (Trello, Jira, etc) for creating and assigning the tickets.
* The plan should be created for a project from some topic's tasks, for example, Beer catalog.
* You should explain the tasks you've created and by which criteria you've assigned them.

## Advanced Requirements

* Simulate the Planning Poker for the sprint planning.
* Let's assume Mike is gonna take a 1-week vacation for the 2nd week.
