<summary>8. What are the most important aspects to verify during Globalisation testing?</summary>

>#### Answer
>
> * **User Interface.** Each language script has a different writing style (few are written from left to right and few
> are from right to left direction) and the space required by the words might vary from one language to another. So
> there is a need to test the UI layout in each language in order to ensure that the UI is clean and there are no issues
> like text overlapping, misalignment of text, navigation issues, etc.
> * **Date & Time format.** The date & time display formats will vary from region to region. The most common date format
> in the US is mm/dd/yyyy. Contrary to this, the most common date format in Europe is dd/mm/yyyy. So, it is critical to
> ensure that the date & time is displayed in the appropriate format when you switch to different regions/countries.

> the formatting. Another important thing is to display the correct symbol of currency along with the units.

> another. In Japanese, the address order is a postal code, state, city. Whereas, in English, the address order is name,
> city, state, postal code. So, you need to verify if the address order display is working fine as you switch between
> different languages supported by your app.

### Memory Leaks Testing

<details>
<summary>1. What is a memory leak?</summary>

>#### Answer
>
> A **memory leak** is an uncontrolled decrease in the amount of free RAM and virtual memory related to errors in
> running applications that don't free up unused parts of memory that as a result become inaccessible to the running
> application and to other one.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Why do we need to test memory leaks?</summary>

>#### Answer
>
> * A memory leak is a bug
> * Subtle memory leaks can lead to unexpected and hard-to-debug problems in the future
> * Not all applications consume little memory, and not all devices allocate a lot of memory, so even minor memory leaks
> can cause problems in an application
> * If an application has been running for a long time, memory leaks will accumulate in it
> * Memory leaks cause a number of problems:
>   * freezes
>   * decreased productivity
>   * application crash
>   * problems with other applications
