### Fulfill tasks below using Chrome dev tools

1. Find elements in DOM using different locator types
   <http://automationpractice.com/index.php?id_category=3&controller=category>. As a result return what you input in DOM
   search in dev tools for every locator type:

   * Find by id Search box \<form> element
   * Find by classname Search button (with magnifier icon) \<button> element
   * Find by name Search button (with magnifier icon) \<button> element
   * Find by partial link "DRESSES" reference \<a> element
   * Find by link text "Our Stores" reference \<a> element
   * Find by XPATH "Subcategories" \<p> element
   * Find by CSS Logo \<img> element
   * Find by Tag name \<header> element

2. Using different XPath axes find on web page <http://www.way2automation.com/demo.html> following elements or element
   groups. As a result return correspondent XPath queries:

   * Using \<header> element find all its child elements (1 level beneath).
   * Using \<header> element find all its ancestor elements (all possible levels beneath).
   * Using \<header> element find all its \<li> ancestors.
   * Using \<header> element find its 2nd \<li> ancestor.
   * Using \<header> element find its ancestor \<i> element that contains 'skype' in classname.
   * Define "Interaction" \<h1> element by text and find its parent div
   * Define "Home" \<a> element by text, then find its parent \<li> and finally find all menu \<li> elements
