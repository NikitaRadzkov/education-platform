# Curriculum

This documentation was created to help mentors prepare individual curricula for their students. Curriculum project
accumulates lots of various technical content in a convenient form so that it can be used as a primary guide for a
mentor.

## Topics

The *topic* is an independent and comprehensive training unit. *Topic* includes theoretical materials, tasks,
questions and artifacts. Every topic is a solid group of materials grouped by a topic.

## Topics Structure

Every topic should consist of the following parts:

* Theory - any theoretical materials (presentations, video, books, external links).
* Tasks and Task Groups - practical tasks and any complementary materials. Similar tasks may be grouped.
* Questions - initial interview questions to determine student's knowledge level and exam questions/tasks to check
    student's progress after *topic* completion.
