## Requirements

* Design object oriented model using one of suggested systems below.
* Use: classes, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, encapsulation.
* Each class, method, and variable must have a meaningful name and informative composition.
* You need to think carefully about which classes are needed to solve the problem.
* Inheritance should only be applied when it makes sense.
* Classes should be intelligently distributed by packages.
* Working with the console or the console menu should be minimal (only the necessary data for input, output only what is
  requested in the problem statement).
* A task is some kind of subject area in which it is required to select the necessary class hierarchy and implement it
  using OOP (using inheritance, if necessary, or by implementing interfaces).
* Each class should have the fields and methods you deem necessary.
* The program must create objects of various classes in the selected subject area, combine them into a set of objects
  (use collections).
* As a rule, the task requires you to search for objects according to the specified criteria.
