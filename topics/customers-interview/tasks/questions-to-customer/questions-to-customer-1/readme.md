## Requirements

**Project Description:** Project is a platform for exploration, measurement, collaboration and storytelling. It goes
beyond charts and graphs to provide rich text annotation, external Web component embedding and document integration, as
well as powerful tables designed to make data interrogation intuitive and deep. Application automates the collection of
data from the tools, technologies, and agencies you rely on. Our marketing-specific data ingestion and ETL engine makes
it simpleâ€”just connect your data sources via API, SFTP drops, or Excel uploads. Also it offers your team the power to
edit data without technology support or programming skills. This simplifies the work required to harmonize, map,
cleanse, and reconcile disparate and unusable marketing data.

**Environment**: React.js, Redux, HTML5/CSS3, LESS, ES6, Immutable.js, Webpack, ASP.NET WebAPI, OWIN, Entity Framework,
Autofac, Mono, Docker.
