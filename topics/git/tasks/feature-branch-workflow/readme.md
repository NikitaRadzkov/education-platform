You should create markdown document. You can read about markdown

Each section should has at least 100 characters.

### Repository

1. Create public repository with name `gitflow-task` on your github account.
2. Create empty `description.md` file in master branch.
3. Create develop branch from master.
4. Add each section in `description.md` file in separate branch which
    will created from development. Name each branch with next structure  -> feature/(name of feature).
    Add your changes, create a tag, commit changes and push them.
5. Create pull request for each branch and merge them.
6. Create pull request from develop to master.

### Commits

1. Limit the message line to 50 characters
2. Do not end the message line with a dot
3. Use the present tense ("add dropdown style" not ~~"added dropdown style"~~)
4. Use the imperative mood in the message line ("add dropdown style" not
    \~\~"I add dropdown style"\~\~)

### Pull request

1. Should have the name of task and perhaps additional information.
2. Changes shouldn't contain comments, autogenerated files like .vscode or .idea and others.
    Use .gitignore file for this.
