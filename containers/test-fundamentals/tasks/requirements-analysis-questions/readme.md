* What symbols can be used in names of files which user upload from operation system?

* Hey Danniel! =) What do u think, what are file types are allowed in user Profile?
* Could you answer one simple question? I'm sorry to trouble you, but I met a mismatch in the new specification for
  Search. Unfortunately, in the old specification it is written that "System finds hit in shared documents only", but in
  the new specification for search we have section "Peculiarities search in private documents". Could you possibly
  change one of the specifications or maybe explain me what it means? Thanks in advance, the answer would really help
  me. I'm looking forward to your letter!
* In requirements we have the point: "If date isn't selected, date is put automatically". But what if the date was
  selected?
* I have a question: it's written in requirements that to launch the program we need to double click on the icon. But
  it's launched by one click.
* I have some questions about new features: can every user get administrator role? Can the system have several users
  with administrator role? What permissions does user with moderator role have? What permissions does user with
  administrator role have? How many roles does user have?
* System let us login only when a user account field has 8 characters long. But some membership numbers are only 7
  digits long. What should we do?
* There are five fields in registering page: password, name, nickname, surname and email. The first field can contain no
  more than 75 symbols and only letters and digits, second and third fields too, password â€“ 130 symbols. But we don't
  know length limit of email.
* We have this requirement: "To login to the application user must enter username, password, and verification code". I
  don't understand it.
