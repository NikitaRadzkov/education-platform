> **Answer:**
>
> Stored Procedure is a function consists of many SQL statement to access the database system.
> Several SQL statements are consolidated into a stored procedure and execute them whenever and wherever required.

</details>

<details>
<summary>29. What is a transaction?</summary>

> **Answer:**
>
> A transaction is a sequence of code that runs against a database. It takes database from one consistent state to another.

</details>

<details>
<summary>30. What are the properties of a transaction?</summary>

> **Answer:**
>
> Generally these properties are referred as ACID properties. They are:
>
> * `A`tomicity - `Transactions` are often composed of multiple statements. `Atomicity` guarantees that each `transaction` is treated as a single "unit", which either succeeds completely, or fails completely: if any of the statements constituting a `transaction` fails to complete, the entire `transaction` fails and the database is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee `atomicity` in each and every situation, including power failures, errors and crashes.
> * `C`onsistency - `Consistency` ensures that a `transaction` can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants: any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This prevents database corruption by an illegal `transaction`, but does not guarantee that a `transaction` is correct. Referential integrity guarantees the primary key - foreign key relationship.
> * `I`solation - `Transactions` are often executed concurrently (e.g., reading and writing to multiple tables at the same time). `Isolation` ensures that concurrent execution of `transactions` leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the `transactions` were executed sequentially. `Isolation` is the main goal of concurrency control; depending on the method used, the effects of an incomplete `transaction` might not even be visible to other `transactions`.
> * `D`urability - `Durability` guarantees that once a `transaction` has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash). This usually means that completed `transactions` (or their effects) are recorded in non-volatile memory.

</details>

<details>
<summary>31. What are the different Isolation Levels?</summary>

> **Answer:**
>
> Transactions specify an isolation level that defines the degree to which one transaction must be isolated from resource or data modifications made by other transactions. Isolation levels are described in terms of which concurrency side effects, such as dirty reads or phantom reads, are allowed.
>
> The following table shows the concurrency side effects allowed by the different isolation levels.
>
> | Isolation Level  | Dirty Read | Non Repeatable Read | Phantom |
> | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------- |
> | Read uncommitted | Yes        | Yes                 | Yes     |
> | Read committed   | No         | Yes                 | Yes     |
> | Repeatable read  | No         | No                  | Yes     |
> | Snapshot         | No         | No                  | No      |
> | Serializable     | No         | No                  | No      |
>
> **Read Uncommitted** Transactions running at this level do not issue shared locks to prevent other transactions from modifying data read by the current transaction. Also, transactions are not blocked by exclusive locks at the time of data modification, thus allowing other transactions to read the modified data which is not yet committed.
>
> **Read Committed** With Read Committed, transactions issue exclusive locks at the time of data modification, thus not allowing other transactions to read the modified data that is not yet committed. The Read Committed isolation level prevents the Dirty Read issue. However, data can be changed by other transactions between individual statements within the current transaction, resulting in a Non-repeatable Read or a Phantom Row.
>
> **Repeatable Read** In Repeatable Read, statements cannot read data that has been modified but not yet committed by other transactions. No other transaction can modify data that has been read by the current transaction until the current transaction completes. Shared locks are placed on all data read by each statement in the transaction and are held until the transaction completes. This prevents other transactions from modifying any rows that have been read by the current transaction. This isolation level prevents the Non-Repeatable Read issue. Other transactions can insert new rows that match the search conditions of statements issued by the current transaction. If the current transaction then retries the statement it will retrieve the new rows, which results in phantom reads.
>
> **Serializable** In the serializable isolation level, statements cannot read data that has been modified but not yet committed by other transactions. No other transactions can modify data that has been read by the current transaction until the current transaction completes. Other transactions cannot insert new rows with key values that would fall in the range of keys read by any statements in the current transaction until the current transaction completes.
>
> **Snapshot** In snapshot isolation, data read by any statement in a transaction will be the transactional consistent version of the data that existed at the start of the transaction. Data modifications made by other transactions after the start of the current transaction are not visible to statements executing in the current transaction. SNAPSHOT transactions do not request locks when reading data. SNAPSHOT transactions reading data do not block other transactions from writing data. Transactions writing data do not block SNAPSHOT transactions from reading data.

<summary>32. What is an Index?</summary>

> **Answer:**
>
> An Index is an special structure associated with a table speed up the performance of queries. Index can be created on one or more columns of a table.

</details>

<details>
<summary>33. What are all the different types of indexes?</summary>

> **Answer:**
>
> There are three types of indexes:
>
> * Unique Index - This indexing does not allow the field to have duplicate values if the column is unique indexed. Unique index can be applied automatically when primary key is defined.
> * Clustered Index - This type of index reorders the physical order of the table and search based on the key values. Each table can have only one clustered index.
> * NonClustered Index - NonClustered Index does not alter the physical order of the table and maintains logical order of data. Each table can have many nonclustered indexes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>34. What is Normalization?</summary>

> **Answer:**
>
> The process of table design to minimize the data redundancy is called normalization.
> We need to divide a database into two or more table and define relationships between them.
